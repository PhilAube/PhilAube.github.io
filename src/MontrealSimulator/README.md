# Game Programming F21 Project - Montreal Simulator

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this side-scroller driving game, players assume the role of a driver and navigate their car in the hazardous streets of Montreal. They will meet several obstacles along the way, which can have various effects on the player's vehicle.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Players can accelerate, brake and switch lanes using the **ARROW KEYS**.

They can also honk their horn with the **SPACEBAR**.

The game can be paused by pressing **ENTER**.

The player has a score which is calculated based on their speed (faster = better).

To win each level, the player has to reach a specific target score.

The level system gradually increases that target as the player progresses in the game.

As they progress, the player can unlock new vehicles with better stats.

Vehicles have 3 stats: 
- Health
- Acceleration
- Top Speed

Potholes and cones will lower the vehicle's health and slow the vehicle down.

Oil slicks will spin the player out, briefly brief causing a loss of control. 

Collisions with other AI vehicles will instantly lead to a game over.

Poutines will restore vehicle health.

The skyline image was edited so that its background would be transparent.

If any other images were edited, it was just for cropping and resizing.

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

In terms of fonts, I kept it simple with the __Joystix__ font that has been used throughout this semester.

The font's retro feel pairs pretty well with the type of arcade-style game that I'm designing.

#### üîä Sounds

- Music is original (written/produced/recorded by myself).

- Poutine power-up sound effect created by myself.

- Menu select sound effect created by myself.

- Menu nope sound effect created by myself.

- Obstacle collision sound effect sourced from [here](https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/sounds/270332/).

- Game over sound effect sourced from [here](https://freesound.org/people/jalastram/sounds/317763/).

- Victory fanfare sound effect sourced from [here](https://freesound.org/people/colorsCrimsonTears/sounds/580310/).

- Tire skid sound effect sourced from [here](https://www.videvo.net/sound-effect/auto-skid-21/401932/). 

- Horn Honk sound effect sourced from [here](https://www.videvo.net/sound-effect/jeep-chrke-horn-honks-pe894412/248649/).

The horn sound was edited to only contain the first honk, and the tire skid was sped up slightly.
