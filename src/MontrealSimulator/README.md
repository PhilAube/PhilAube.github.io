# Montreal Simulator

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this side-scroller driving game, you navigate their car in the hazardous streets of Montreal. 

You will meet several obstacles along the way, which can have various effects on your vehicle.

## üé≤ Gameplay

Your score is calculated based on your speed (faster = better).

To win each level, you have to reach a specific target distance.

The game gradually adds 1KM to the target every time you win a level.

As you progress, you can unlock up to 3 new vehicles with better stats.

Vehicles have 3 stats: 

- Health
- Acceleration
- Top Speed

On the road:

- **Potholes** and **cones** lower your vehicle's health and slow it down.

- **Oil slicks** spin your vehicle out, briefly brief causing a loss of control. 

- **Poutines** restore your vehicle's health.

## üîß Setup

If you wish to play this game with a gamepad/controller, simply connect it to your device via Bluetooth or cable.

Once that is done, go to the game's browser window and try pressing some buttons on the gamepad/controller.

If you set things up correctly, you should see a connection confirmation appear from the bottom.

If that worked, you're ready to play the game! If not, I'd suggest [this website](https://gamepad-tester.com/) for troubleshooting.
